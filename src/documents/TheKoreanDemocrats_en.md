## **A Real Change – Not Exchange!**

### **Welcome to the Korean Democrats, a political party in south Korea:**

#### **A party of tomorrow and for the future.**

The Korean Democrats is a political party of tomorrow and towards the future. Its policies are always forward and should always be dealt with an opened mind.

Its major aim is to build up such a political party which shall be free from the non-democratic and pri-modern traditions which most of the today’s political parties in south Korea have been based upon. The political parties should be created by the free and voluntaristic association and participation by the groups of the people who have the same interests and ideology where members of the party choose their leader and also by the open and fair method of economic donation. Not by the few political leaders and not by the secret method of economic donation.

Even one hundred won from the poor but the courageous person who believes in Democracy and the human dignity and has never been a member of any political movement are most welcome to our party. Also democratic-minded activitists who want a change but not an exchange are welcome and joining our heroic movement for building a new tradition in the political life.

**We want a real change and not an exchange of power.**

Our party is the political party by the people, of the people and for the people. The way to be a member is free and open to every body who agrees to our aims and want to join this historical movement.

We should have learnt lessons from the past . From those past lessons we should correctly separate what is good from what is bad. Then we should throw away the bad ones and maintain and develop the good ones. In a process of decision making, we will use the value-premises. If we do not take away the coloured spectacles from our eyes, we can not see what is white and what is black. Then we can know where we are standing now and what we are doing now. In such lights, we can walk towards the future and the people can decide their future by themselves.

Modern science has shown us that children as only as 8 months old have their moral, dislikening unfair behaviour and avoid “ evil “ toys. Even animals have been shown that they have their own moral.

So why shouldn’t we, the people who have both moral and ethics exercise it.

Our future society should be based upon honesty, without injustice, discrimination, and corruption where the human rights and the human dignity are well respected , and every citizen shall be treated equally by the law in every field of the socio-economic and political life.

**A real Democracy.**

In a real democracy, the peoples are the only and legitimate sources of power, and all peoples in a democracy have equal rights and nobody shall be treated differently.

Therefore democracy and equality are inseparable. How much and how long have our peoples been treated differently and discriminated, by the differences of the birth areas, by the school differences and by the family background, and by the differences of wealth and so on.

In a real Democracy, there is no one single difference between the ordinary citizen and the President. They are belonging to the same category of the people who has a exact same right and duty as a citizen.

**The military Dictatorships.**

The pre-modern or the feudalistic traditions of the power and the authority in south Korea have been originated from the feudalistic monarchy’s and the colonial powers and the military dictatorships where Confucianism has been very much and strongly misused. Therefore, there has not been any progress for Democracy in the south Korea ,because we Koreans have never been free from such pre-modern and feudalistic culture and tradition. Even under the present political system which the people in the south have elected a female as the President in the such strongly confucianistic society, the right of the woman is strongly violated and it has not been any special progress. Instead the violation against the truth and democracy by the female President is acceptable by the name of Confucianism as” **a devoted daughter for her father**”, filial duties.

In democracy, the occupation of the President means to do services for the people. The politicians are elected by the peoples after they have promised to work and to do services for the peoples. Therefore, any occupation does not give any personal power to the owner of the occupation.

We have wasted too many years of establishing Democracy since 1960. Now we should stop any kind of cooperation of the dictatorship. How many young lives have been sacrificed to overthrow the Dictator Syng-man Rhee ? How many our younger generations and workers have been sacrificed to overthrow the Military Dictatorship. But the opportunistic politicians have never done any progress for Democracy but have cooperated with dictators by using the slogan of the moderate change of the country and the cancer of the vicious dictatorship has been getting back significantly now.

1). When the chairman of the parliament participated in the ceremony for the monument of the dictator Rhee. There were no any protest.

2).There was no any movement against the misuse of the power by the President when she prosecuted a leading member of the parliament who is elected by the people.

3). No angry protests against naming so called “ the great national leaders “ such as the dictator Rhee, the dictator Park and the President Park.

This is a dictatorship led by a female political leader. Everybody knows well but nobody dare to discuss it. Such environment has been developing in south Korea both wide and deep.

**Programs for Democracy.**

**The respect for the human rights and the human dignity** is our fundamental valuation.—the human rights are a necessary condition for democracy. Those are universal, non separable and individual. The struggle against discrimination such as gender discrimination, disability discrimination etc.  All kinds of freedoms of the human rights should be fully realized and respected.

In particular, the woman’s right, the worker’s right, and the rights of the younger generation should be respected and in particular, the equality of opportunity between man and woman is a central problem of the modern society and the legalization. Those are also personal rights.

**The complete elimination and forbidden of violence and inhuman methods of any legislation or legal exercises.**

These human rights and dignity should be based on the respect for life. Dignity of life and respect for life should be deeply and widely implemented in the whole society

Life is most valuable and most respectable. Nobody can reject this principle. Any kind of method of torture psychologically and physically should be totally abolished and forbidden. The inhuman methods of the excursion of the dead sentence should also be abolished and the area for the dead sentence should be systematically minimized and prepared finally to be abolished . Nobody should be suffered from any kind of the inhuman treatments. Any Korean has an absolute right to survive as a decent human being. We all Koreans should have a strong solidarity with each other, such as brothers and sisters who should care for one other.

**Welfare Society.**

Therefore a welfare system is the necessary condition for implementing meaningfully such principles. The modern north European social insurance system should be carefully studied and implemented now in south Korea.

**New Educational System.**

The 6-years compulsory education should now be developed to the 9 years system. The educational system should not be just formal but should be functional and be prepared pupils for the future.

**Anti-corruption and openness**:

Openness and observation in all public activities. Protection of the so-called “whistleblowers” and informators for everybody in order to strengthen the hard work against corruption.

**The new movement for the coexistence between the human-being and the nature.**

We the human-beings are the last comer to the nature. Everything has been existed before the human-being arrived. Therefore, we human-being can not exist without the nature. This simple evidence has been very much ignored and we are ruthlessly over-consuming the nature. This over-consuming should be restricted and join the international cooperation for the environmental movement. Energy saving technology and ecological living should be developed. The capital city of the south Korea is one of the worst areas of environmental disaster in the world.

**The urgent need for the mutual independence of three authorities( the Legistrature, the executive and the judicature).**

These principle s crucial for Democracy for protecting the rights and interests of the people which does not exists now in south Korea. This principle should be protected and functional. While the legisture and the judicature have been severely enticed and inveigled, no one tries to struggle against such severe violation of the principle of democracy.

It is most urgent to set up this principle for Democracy in the south Korea.

**The peace in the Korean peninsula and the need for a new international cooperation.**

A new type of the Far East Asian Pease and Economic cooperation Committee should be set up, whose primary members are China, Twain, Japan, north Korea and south Korea and the countries as observer-status are America and Russia for a permanent and actual establishment of Peace in the Korean peninsula and in Far East Asia and even in the world.

We need cooperation but not subordination. Is the establishment for anti-missile system really for the security of the south Korea ? , or the base for control over Russia and China as a world police ? Is there any other country except the south Korea in the world which can not decide his own military defense . We want to have a friendship with America but the Korean self-determination should be first priority. The Korean-American relationship should be newly set up on the principle of equality which might be similar to the German and American relationship. We work for the international cooperation but truly under the firm principle of equality. The soverity of Korea should be carefully restored.

It is not justice and equality that the south Korea has done the treaty with Japan about the Japanese war crimes against our people (i.e. enslaved Korean females misused by Japanese soldiers during the 2nd world war).

Without any notices to the south Korea, the military exercises in the Korean territory hade been carried out by the American-Japanese military. These are not cooperation but subordination and without any respect for soverity of the south Korea.

The world situation has been changed politically and economically since the 2nd world war in 1945 and the Korean war in 1950. But in Korea has not yet been any progress in peace and change taken place, even 25 years after falling down of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Are we not qualified to solve these obstacles by our selves free from the foreign interests.

We Koreans have been as children and nonages dependent upon parents for protection for more than 70 years. It is too long for over 70 years not to have been treated as an adult. How long shall we be treated as mentally and physically handicapped who need a guardian. Is there any nation like us ? We are the only one in this world. We ought to be shameful of it.

Now we should stand up by ourselves as an adult.

Also the Korean Democrats will cooperate with , and support the international organizations such as international NGO or any institution and leading person for Democracy, Peace and the protection of Nature.

**About the unification:**

Without the north and the south Koreas have become democratic, there is no future for discussion of the unification. If there will be an unification , it  will be a take over by one part over the other. The history and the reality of Germany and those of Korea are very different. We should not have any fantasies of the unification of Germany which might be a larger tragedy than that of the Korean war. The future of Korea should be decided by us the Koreans. Not by any intervention by the supper power or any foreign countries. Too much the supper powers and the foreign nations have played powerful and ignored our interests and rights for our future up to date. Until we set up democracy in Korea there shall be no peaceful and non-violent way for unification. The most urgent way is how democracy can be functional. Until that time, we try to establish peace in two Koreas and the peaceful coexistence. We try to solve our problems by the methods of dialogue not by the confrontation. We both must struggle for such development.

**A Committee of the Truth.**

The Truth Committee is a highest organization of this party. Which judges who Korean Democrats truly are and re- examine and study the modern Korean history under the objective and truth commitment of Justice. the Bishop Desmond Tutu and the President Nelson Mandela in the south Africa has done it under courage and consciousness.

All kinds of law and regulation should be re-examined on the modern situation and principle.

No Korean should be afraid to be judged. Any who is lying and has closed mind to tell the truth shall be a bad person who will have a bad health. The person who can tell the truth, and admitted his mistakes or confess what he has done the crimes, he or she will be free from his inner pains psychologically and be healthy. We should give up all kinds of inhuman methods to treat the criminal persons and should rehabitarize those criminal for the normal and cleaned citizens or human being to start their new life in the long term.

Our society should not discriminate any condemned person and support such rehabilitation for the condemned person. Through these processes of the judgements under the truth committee, the Korea shall march to the future for the honest society with firm solidarity.

In particularly we should re-examine all political prisoners who might be false accused and heavily suffered and also the politicians who did big mistakes politically and still hide his secrete crimes which can be soon found out, since nearly all records of such political crimes and secrets have been well reserved in the secret records. Such political crimes shall never be hidden and should be severely punished if not confessed.

Democracy is how to solve social problem and differences among different social groups with discussion(dialogue) by the non-violent method, tolerance, so that utilize all kind possible democratic means and all kinds of the people.

Unity is dictatorship but existences for different ideal organizations and pluralism are democracy. Only solution for democracy is not confrontation but for dialogue.

Majority rule for democracy is necessary but not sufficient condition, and the representatives system for democracy has been very much misused and as a really like a dictatorship of a minority rule by parliament and president elected by the people. How many times the direct voting by the people has been held in south Korea. Really none. The direct voting should be mobilized in times and in methods.
